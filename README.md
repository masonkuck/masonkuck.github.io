## Welcome to Mason Kuck's Github Page

I will be posting code here that I have found helpful/interesting in my endeavors. I am currently employed as .Net developer working on WPF and ASP.Net projects. I also work on arduino projects quite often in my freetime. You can expect to see all of these technologies here.
